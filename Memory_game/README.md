Memory Game ðŸ§ ðŸŽ´

This is a simple Memory Game implemented in Python. The game generates a grid of hidden numbers, and the player must match pairs by flipping cards two at a time.

ðŸŽ¯ How to Play

The player enters a grid size (e.g., 4 for a 4x4 grid).

The game shuffles pairs of numbers and places them in a hidden grid.

The player flips two cards at a time by entering their row and column positions.

If the two selected cards match, they remain open.

If they don't match, they flip back to hidden.

The game continues until all pairs are found or the maximum allowed turns are exceeded.
